# Recommender-System-Using-Spark-MLib

In this notebook I have created a movie recommendation system using Spark ML. The data has been take from the MovieLens 1M dataset (http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens). This dataset consists of more than 1 million ratings of approximately 4000 movies made by 6000 MovieLens users who joined MovieLens in 2000. MovieLens is a recommender system and virtual community website that recommends movies for its users to watch, based on their film preferences using collaborative filtering. 

The project has been created on a cluster setup using Databricks. The link to the databricks notebook is provided below:
